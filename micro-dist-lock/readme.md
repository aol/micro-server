# Distributed lock plugin

This plugin provides some common code for distributed lock. Clients use it only need to provide key/keys. If multiple keys are provided, the concatenated key will be used.

This plugin needs to be used in conjunction with a concrete distributed lock plugin i.e. micro-mysql plugin.

This plugin also provides rest end points which can be used to check if a process is main process.
