# Distributed lock plugin

[micro-dist-lock example apps](https://github.com/aol/micro-server/tree/master/micro-dist-lock/src/test/java/app)

This plugin provides some common code for distributed lock. 

## DistributedLockManager

DistributedLockManager provides a way to bundle a DistributedLock Service and the lock together, it can be instantiated directly

```java
    DistributedLockService distributedLockService;
    DistributedLockManager manager = new DistributedLockManager("key",distributedLockService);
    
    manager.isMainProcess();
```

You can create your own Spring Beans via Spring Configuration class
```java
    @Configuration
    public class MyConfig{
    
        @Autowired
        DistributedLockService distributedLockService;
        
        @Bean
        public DistributedLockManager manager(){
            return new DistributedLockManager("key",distributedLockService);  
        }
    
    }
```



This plugin is abstract and to take effect needs to be used in conjunction with a concrete distributed lock plugin i.e. micro-mysql plugin.

This plugin also provides a rest end point which can be used to check if a process owns a lock for a given lockName or lockKey.
