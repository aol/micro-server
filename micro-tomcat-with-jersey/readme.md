# Tomcat, Jersey and Microserver together

[Example Tomcat & Jersey Apps](https://github.com/aol/micro-server/tree/master/micro-tomcat/src/test/java/app)

Convenience module that packages Tomcat, Jersey, Jackson and Microserver together

## Note

Tomcat does not currently support the Microserver micro-monolith style of development where by multiple Microservers can be rolled up into a single 'monolithic' style services at runtime. If you require that type of functionality take a look at micro-grizzly instead.
